Let’s understand how tech \\nis facilitating and augmenting  learning for a future -ready workforce:  \\n• Upskill platforms are already tech-first:  Software platforms for upskilling need integration of  multiple \\nstandalone technology platforms to provide an end -to-end learning experience. These may be course \\nstorefronts, CRM systems, or course enrolment systems that include payment gateway solutions, teaching and \\nlearning systems, assessments, and engage ment platforms. The interplay of technologies here helps in  \\nattracting learners, enhancing the teaching & learning experience, and influencing learner outcomes.  \\n \\n• Driving down the cost of learner acquisition : Companies in the upskilling business are still face d with steep  \\ncosts of learner acquisition . Tech  intervention can help a prospective learner better evaluate several learning \\nplatforms with a  self-driven approach  thus reducing the CAC (C ost of Customer Acquisition) . Instead of \\nexpensive on -the-ground sales teams, prospective learners are now provided with a learner portal that allows \\nthem to take a test -drive of the learning material at their own convenience. Portals for prospective learners can  \\nprovide tech enabled toolsets to evaluate ROI, choose options to fast -track completion  and provide a high \\ndegree of flexibility in class schedules based on  learners ’ convenience . They also provide a feel of the course even \\nbefore enrolment giving prospective learners all the necessary data points to help them  make a well -informed decision.  \\n \\n• Tech -driven skill mapping and gap analysis is shaping personalized  career path s: The need to assess \\nlearners for their propensity to move into new roles, requires an initial test of their skills, identification of gaps, \\nand the mechanism to devise a transformational path to help them make a shift to aspirational roles. Tech can \\nhelp maintain a skills repo sitory focused on the domain of interest, perform skill mapping,  and gap analysis, \\nand chalk out the personalized path for upskilling or re -skilling.  \\n'"

Initial assessments and identification of learners' skills paired with a mechanism for transformational paths helps them shift to aspirational roles.\\n\\nVish: Could you elaborate on how integration of multiple standalone technology platforms in upskilling software platforms enhances the teaching and learning experience?\\nDr. Sheetal: The integration of standalone technology platforms provides an end-to-end learning experience. The interplay between course storefronts, CRM systems, or course enrollment systems that include payment gateway solutions, teaching and learning systems, assessments, and engagement platforms attracts learners, enhances the teaching & learning experience, and influences learner outcomes.

              "\"Vish: Hello and welcome everyone to our show. This is Vish, and I am excited to have you all here. For those of you who are new, I am a host and content creator who loves to have insightful discussions with experts. \\n\\nVish: Today, we have Dr. Sheetal with us to talk about the potential of technology in education. We'll be exploring how software platforms can provide an end-to-end learning experience, reduce learner acquisition costs, and personalize career paths. \\n\\nVish: Dr. Sheetal, we're thrilled to have you on the show. To kick things off, can you share with us: \\n\\n- How can technology help learners evaluate different learning platforms?\\n- What are the benefits of using technology for personalized career paths?\\n- Can you tell us more about technology-driven skills mapping and gap analysis?\\n\\nDr. Sheetal: Vish, thank you for having me on the show. I'm excited to be here and share my insights with your audience. Regarding your questions, technology can provide a self-driven approach for learners to evaluate learning platforms that fit their needs and preferences. Personalized career paths allow learners to identify their skills gaps and take up courses or programs that address those gaps, leading them to upskilling and reskilling transformation paths. Lastly, technology-driven skills mapping can provide insights for learners to effectively manage their learning journey by identifying their key strengths and competencies.Vish: How can technology help in reducing the cost of learner acquisition in the upskilling business?\\nDr. Sheetal: Technology can provide a self-driven approach for prospective learners to evaluate learning platforms, reducing the cost of customer acquisition. Learner portals equipped with toolsets to evaluate ROI, fast-track completion, and flexible class schedules can provide a feel of the course before enrolment, helping learners make a well-informed decision.\\n\\nVish: How can personalized career paths be shaped for the learners using educational technology?\\nDr. Sheetal: Tech-driven skill mapping and gap analysis can maintain a skills repository and identify gaps in learners' skills and chalk out a personalized path for upskilling or reskilling. Initial assessments and identification of learners' skills paired with a mechanism for transformational paths helps them shift to aspirational roles.\\n\\nVish: Could you elaborate on how integration of multiple standalone technology platforms in upskilling software platforms enhances the teaching and learning experience?\\nDr. Sheetal: The integration of standalone technology platforms provides an end-to-end learning experience. The interplay between course storefronts, CRM systems, or course enrollment systems that include payment gateway solutions, teaching and learning systems, assessments, and engagement platforms attracts learners, enhances the teaching & learning experience, and influences learner outcomes. This integration helps in creating a holistic learning experience.\\nThe potential of technology in education and upskilling has been highlighted in our discussion with Dr. Sheetal.
